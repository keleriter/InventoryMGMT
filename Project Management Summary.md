# Project Management Summary #
## Progression of tasks ##
Hello world employed an **Agile Scrum approach**, a framework that allowed us to address complex problems in a flexible and adaptive way (Scrum.org, 2016). Tasks listed in the assignment prompt were dissected into smaller deliverables and the project was divided into two sprints - a two week sprint, and a four day sprint closer to the due date. Deliverables were organised on **Trello**, grouped into To do, Doing and Completed tasks, allowing Hello World to keep track of progress during the sprint. The project was also completed in a **parallel** manner, as the written tasks required certain sections of the code to be complete.

Regular conversations on Facebook Messenger, as well as short, weekly meetings were utilised to keep the team on track. Members updated the team on their progress, future plans and brainstormed new ideas. It is also to be noted that during these meetings, members reviewed and critiqued completed work to suggest areas of improvement. 

## Sharing of Source Code ##
Hello World utilised **Github** to share our source code progress. As well as this, the team utilised Messenger to update team members on which parts of the code were completed or in progress to avoid confusion and overlap. Github allowed the team to have complete **version control** and autonomy over the source code, as the system recorded changes to a file which could be undone if they were undesirable. This allowed the team to commit code, view commit history, and undo commits while working concurrently on the code. In particular, viewing the change history was extremely useful, as the team would easily get confused when members made small adjustments. 

Hello World planned the progression of tasks in the following manner:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Date</td>
    <td>Sprint</td>
    <td>Member</td>
    <td>Tasks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>28/10/2020</td>
    <td>Sprint planning</td>
    <td>All</td>
    <td>Plan two sprints<br>Setup Trello<br>Set deadlines and deliverables<br>Divide source code into 5 deliveerables<br>Set time for weekly meetings</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">30/10/2020</td>

    <td>Member 1 and Member 2</td>
    <td>Project management plan<br>GitHub README.md<br>Usability summary<br>Project form<br>Bugfixes in code</td>

    <td>Member 3</td>
    <td>Source code deliverables 1, 2, 3</td>

    <td>Source code deliverables 4, 5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Convert files to .md and upload to GitHub</td>
  </tr>
</table>
